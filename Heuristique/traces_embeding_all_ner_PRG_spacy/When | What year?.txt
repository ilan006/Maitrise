TEXT 57376a1bc3c5551400e51ec6 = However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.
   
ANSWERS 57376a1bc3c5551400e51ec6 = {'their respective lines of application', 'respective lines of application', 'their effects on motion of body'}

QUESTION 57378862c3c5551400e51f23 = When was the first measurement of the value of the Newton Universal Gravitation Constant?
   
TEXT 57378862c3c5551400e51f23 = Not until 1798 was Henry Cavendish able to make the first measurement of  using a torsion balance; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing  could allow one to solve for the Earth's mass given the above equation.

QUESTION 57378e311c456719005744b0 = When did the origins of magnetic and electric fields occur?
   
TEXT 57378e311c456719005744b0 = The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs.
