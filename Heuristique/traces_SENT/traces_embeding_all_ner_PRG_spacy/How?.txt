QUESTION 56e1a564cd28a01900c67a4b = How is worst-case time complexity written as an expression?
   
TEXT 56e1a564cd28a01900c67a4b = If the input size is n, the time taken can be expressed as a function of n. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n. If T(n) is a polynomial in n, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm.
