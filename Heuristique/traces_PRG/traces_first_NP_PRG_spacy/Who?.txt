QUESTION 57378e311c456719005744af = Who first fully explained the origins of magnetic and electric fields?
   
TEXT 57378e311c456719005744af = The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs.

QUESTION 57378e311c456719005744b3 = Who discovered that magnetic and electric could self-generate?
   
TEXT 57378e311c456719005744b3 = This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be "self-generating" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light.
